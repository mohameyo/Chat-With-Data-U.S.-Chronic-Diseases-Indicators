In this folder, we load our dataset from https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/g4ie-h725/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD website. Then, we start loading and do some preprocessing that we will be using in our LLM approaches.
Output: 
1. filtered_data (preprocessed original data)
2. cdc_data (preprocessed pivotted data format)
