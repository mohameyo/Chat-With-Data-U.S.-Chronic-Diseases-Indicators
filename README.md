# Welcome to the Chat With U.S. Chronic Disease Data Project! ðŸš€

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository! ðŸ¤– In this GitHub, we embark on a journey to create chatbots powered by Large Language Models, specifically the GPT-4 model, using the Gradio library interface. The main goal of this project is to engage in what we term "Chat With Data." The innovation of GPTs has helped businesses think outside the box in developing chatbots based on their own data, powered by LLMs. This approach is undoubtedly superior to creating a basic NLP solution. The evolution of LLMs has significantly contributed to the fields of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Software Development. Industries should start leveraging such models to empower their domains. Our dataset, sourced from CDC's Division of Population Health, provides a comprehensive set of 124 indicators, enabling uniform definition, collection, and reporting of chronic disease data. Feel free to use any data you prefer for chatting, experiment with parameters and functions to achieve the optimal solution, and enjoy conversing with your data.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset is structured with 124 indicators in the column ["Questions"], classified under 17 health topics. Each question is answered across various Stratification categories and data value types. The dataset, in long format, covers state and national levels from 2008 to 2020, with some values presented as averages over a range of years, as indicated in the YearStart and YearEnd columns.

## Getting Started

### 1. Here is a directory guide

Each file contains the following
1. **`data`:**
   - Preprocessed data stored in the data using the [PreprocessingDataFile](./Notebooks/getProcessData.ipynb).
   - Results are available [here](./Data/results.csv), and evaluation questions are provided in [EvaluationQuestions](./Notebooks/evaluation_questions.ipynb).

2. **`Notebooks`:**
   - Additional notebooks for Chat With Data approaches:
     - [PandasLangChain](./Notebooks/Langchain_PandasAgent.ipynb)
     - [RAGLangChain](./Notebooks/Langchain_RAG.ipynb)
     - [PandasLlamaIndex](./Notebooks/Llama_pandasQueryEngine.ipynb)
     - [SQLLlamaIndex](./Notebooks/Llama_SQLAutoVectorQueryEngine.ipynb)
    
   - [visualizations](./Notebooks/visuals.ipynb) used in the [final report](https://bit.ly/CDCR)

3. **`Scripts`:**
   - Files for the Llama index SQL approach.

4. **`Images`:**
   - Sample chatbot outputs and RAG explanations.

5. **`Requirements.txt`:**
   - Essential Python packages and dependencies.
  
6. **`.env`:**
    - Provide your own API keys (OpenAI, Pinecone, Hugging Face, SQL Database).

#### Usage Guide:

1. Execute [`getProcessData`](./Notebooks/getProcessData.ipynb) to preprocess data in 'data'.

2. Update .env with the necessary credentials for OpenAI, Pinecone, Hugging Face, and the SQL Database.

3. Install dependencies using the command: `pip install -r /../requirements.txt`.

4. Explore different Chat With Data approaches in the notebooks.

### 2. Explore Different Approaches
Explore different approaches in the provided notebooks ðŸ§ 

#### - [PandasLangChain](./Notebooks/Langchain_PandasAgent.ipynb)
This notebook demonstrates how to use agents to interact with a Pandas DataFrame, optimized for question answering. The PandasAgent reads the dataframe, executes Python code, and provides answers in a chat format using the Gradio Chatbot Interface.

You can check its documentation here: https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/toolkits/pandas

#### - [Retrieval Augmentation Generation](./Notebooks/Langchain_RAG.ipynb)
Explore challenges with RAG and its optimal use with text data rather than a simple dataframe. Interact with the Chronic disease data using the RAG-LangChain file and Gradio interface.

Here is how RAG works (source: https://blog.langchain.dev/espilla-x-langchain-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-in-llm-powered-question-answering-pipelines/)

You can check its documentation here: https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/

#### - [PandasLlamaIndex](./Notebooks/Llama_pandasQueryEngine.ipynb)
Explore an alternative approach using GPT-4 by initializing the LlamaIndex Pandas agent and prompting GPT for answers. Similar to the LangChain PandasAgent, this approach involves Python coding and returns answers.

#### - [SQLLlamaIndex](./Notebooks/Llama_SQLAutoVectorQueryEngine.ipynb)
Discover another alternative using GPT-4, this time by initializing the LlamaIndex SQL agent and prompting GPT for answers. Similar to the LangChain PandasAgent, this approach involves SQL coding and returns answers.

#### - [Custom GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-3zHG320un-chronic-disease-indicators-expert)
Our final deliverable for the MADS capstone project was finnaly completed as a custom GPT model. No-code, high performance alternative to existing pipelines. Includes the dataset plus a pdf from CDC`s website explaining the rationale and some additional background.

### 3. Evaluation
Compare various approaches by referencing the evaluation questions provided in the evaluation notebook. Assess the performance of each method based on the answers obtained. We encourage you to experiment more advanced evaluation methods discussed in this medium: https://medium.com/discovery-at-nesta/how-to-evaluate-large-language-model-chatbots-experimenting-with-streamlit-and-prodigy-c82db9f7f8d9

## Conclusion
This repository introduces novel approaches, highlighting the capabilities of Large Language Models (GPT-4) for dynamic interactions with data. It presents opportunities for future enhancements, including fine-tuning function parameters, crafting custom agents, refining evaluation methods, and optimizing dataset preprocessing. We strongly encourage collaboration and continuous improvement by welcoming contributions and feedback from you. Your active engagement will contribute to the ongoing evolution and success of this project.
